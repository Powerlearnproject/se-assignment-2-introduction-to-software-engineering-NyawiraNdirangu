Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering
This is the systematic application of engineering principles methods and tools to development and maintenance of high-quality software systems

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? 
Software engineering is an engineering approach to software development.
The difference is that software engineering includes the entire software development lifecycle whereas the traditional programming focuses on writing codes.
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase. 
Planning and analysis-This is gathering of information and finding out what is required and making plans on what is needed.
Design-This is creating a sketch of the desired software.
Implementation-This is using the created software.
Testing-This is running of the software in order to check its functionality and whether it meets the end goal.
Deployment-This is the using of the created software by the people in need of that particular software
Maintenance-This is making changes and updates of the created software.
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? 
Key differences: 
Approach-Waterfall is sequential and linear whereas agile is iterative and incremental
Flexibility-Waterfall is inflexible whereas agile is flexible 
Scenarios:
Waterfall-preferably used in short term projects
Agile-preferably used in long term projects
What are requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle. 
Requirement engineering is the process of defining, documenting and maintaining the requirements for a software system.
Process:
Elicit-gathering information
Analyze-Examining and refining requirements 
Specify-documenting requirements in a detailed and structured manner
Validate-ensuring the documented requirements are accurate
Manage-monitoring and updating requirements as the project evolves
Importance: ensures clear understanding of requirements, reduces risks and guides development.
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity is breaking down of a software system into smaller manageable units called modules.
Maintainability-it becomes easier to understand and even update.
Scalability-simplifies the addition of new features and components 
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development? 
Unit testing-testing of individual components
Integration testing-tests interactions between components
System testing- testing of the whole system
Acceptance testing-testing the user acceptance
Importance: Testing ensures the functionality of a software 
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features. 
Version control systems manage changes to source code over time
Importance: VCS allows multiple developers work on a particular project simultaneously, track changes and also branching and merging.
Examples: 
Git-distributed widely used
SVN-Centralized Version control
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects? 
Role: He/ She oversees the execution and delivery of a project.
Key responsibilities: resource allocation, risk assessment, team management and project planning
Challenges: Team coordination, resource constraints and technical challanges
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle? 
Software maintenance -this is the improvement through updates, corrections or optimization of a software in use.
Types
Corrective -fixing of bugs
Adaptive -environment changes
Perfective-enhancements
Preventive-preventing an issue from occurring
Importance: ensures the software remains relevant and useful
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work? 
Ethical issues: Privacy violation and security vulnerability
Adherence: Following professional codes of ethics and ensuring user well being
